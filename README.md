# Whitewater Mapping

Born in 1977 to parents who are whitewater paddlers themselves, I arguably have been paddling for 38 of my 37 years. I have proof, a picture of my mother when she was pregnet on the river. During all of this time, my father also is a hopeless map geek. While I do remember learning how to read, I do not remember learning how to understand a topographic map. It simply was something I knew how to do for as long as I can remember.

Now, as am employee of Esri it only seems logical there should be better mapping resources available for not only working, but also for whitewater rivers. While a variety of fragmented sources do exist regionally, easily the most comprehensive and complete dataset detailing whitewater recreational assets in the United States is the American Whitewater National Rivers Database. Although the location information quality varies widely, it is a surprisingly good staring point to create a rich whitewater spatial dataset.

## Challenges

### Massive Volume of Reaches (5,600)

American Whitewater's National Rivers Database is far and above the most comprehensive and complete dataset detailing whitewater in the United States. In this dataset, there are right around 5,600 reaches with access coordinates, either coordinates for a put-in, take-out, or preferably both. 

### Data Integrity

### Consistency with Existing Resources

## Priorities

### Automation

Five thousand, six hunderd reaches is a lot of little squiggly lines to locate. While options such as slave labor, research assistants, and interns came to mind, I opted to use a wonderfully useful tool for mundane and repetitive tasks - the computer. Specifically, a Python script running in ArcGIS.

### Facilitate Revisions
